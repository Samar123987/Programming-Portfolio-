# Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my *Programming Portfolio* repository. This repository contains various programs written in *C* and *C++*. The programs demonstrate my knowledge and practice of basic programming concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

## C Programs
The *C* folder contains basic programs written in the C language, demonstrating fundamental concepts.

### Programs in the *C* folder:
- *CGPA Calculator*: A program that calculates the CGPA based on student grades.
- *Factorial Finder*: A program that calculates the factorial of a number.
- *Fibonacci Series*: A program to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
- *Prime Number Checker*: A program to check if a given number is prime.
- *Simple Calculator*: A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- *Temperature Converter*: A program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

## C++ Programs
The *C++* folder contains programs written in the C++ language. These programs aim to demonstrate the use of C++ features like classes, object-oriented programming, and other features.

### Programs in the *C++* folder:
- *Even/Odd Checker*: A program that checks if a number is even or odd.
- *Factorial Finder*: A program that calculates the factorial of a number using C++.
- *Fibonacci Series*: A program that generates the Fibonacci series using C++.
- *Leap Year Checker*: A program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
- *Simple Calculator*: A C++ calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder of the language (C or C++).
3. Open the desired .c or .cpp file in a code editor.
4. Use any C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Dev C++) to compile the program.
5. Run the program to see the output.
