# Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Programming Portfolio repository. This repository contains various programs written in C and C++. The programs demonstrate my knowledge and practice of basic programming concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

## C Programs
The C folder contains basic programs written in the C language, demonstrating fundamental concepts.

### Programs in the C folder:
- *CGPA Calculator*: A program that calculates the CGPA based on student grades.
- *Factorial Finder*: A program that calculates the factorial of a number.
- *Fibonacci Series*: A program to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
- *Prime Number Checker*: A program to check if a given number is prime.
- *Simple Calculator*: A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- *Temperature Converter*: A program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

## C++ Programs
The C++ folder contains programs written in the C++ language. These programs aim to demonstrate the use of C++ features like classes, functions, and other basic concepts.

### Programs in the C++ folder:
- *Even/Odd Checker*: A program that checks if a number is even or odd.
- *Factorial Finder*: A program that calculates the factorial of a number using C++.
- *Fibonacci Series*: A program that generates the Fibonacci series using C++.
- *Leap Year Checker*: A program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
- *Simple Calculator*: A C++ calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- *Calculate Electricity Bill*  
     - This program calculates the electricity bill based on the following criteria:
     - Up to 100 units: ₹5 per unit.
     - 101 to 300 units: ₹7 per unit.
     - Above 300 units: ₹10 per unit.
     - The program will display the total bill based on the units entered by the user.

- *Check Character Type (Uppercase, Lowercase, or Special Symbol)*  
   - This program checks whether the entered character is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or a special symbol.

- *Find Largest of 3 Numbers*  
   - This program takes three numbers as input and checks which one is the largest among them.

- *Determine Grade*  
   - This program determines the grade of a student based on their marks:
     - Marks ≥ 90: Grade A.
     - Marks ≥ 80: Grade B.
     - Marks ≥ 70: Grade C.
     - Marks ≥ 60: Grade D.
     - Otherwise: Fail.

- *Check Eligibility for Voting*  
   - This program checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The legal voting age is 18, so the program will check if the person’s age is 18 or above.

- *Vowel Checker*  
   - This program checks if the entered character is a vowel (A, E, I, O, U). It takes a single character input and determines if it's a vowel or not.

- *Positive, Negative, or Zero Number Checker*  
   - This program checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero. It evaluates the number and outputs whether it's positive, negative, or zero based on the input.

- *Prime Number Checker*  
   - This program checks whether a given number is prime or not.

- *Print Pattern*  
   - A simple program that prints a pattern of stars in increasing order:
     
     *
     **
     ***
     ****
     *****
     

- *Print Table of Any Number*  
   - This program prints the multiplication table of any given number.

- *Reverse the Number*  
   - This program takes a number as input and outputs its reverse. For example, for the input 12345, the output will be 54321.

- *Sum of Digits of Numbers*  
   - This program calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. For example, for the input 123, the output will be 6 (1+2+3).

- *Sum of Natural Numbers*  
   - This program calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers.
